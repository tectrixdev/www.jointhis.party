## Self-hosting a minecraft server.

This guide will fully guide you through setting up a local minecraft server and forwarding it to the network.

# Setting up the server.
You should have some dedicated server hardware, although you can just run it on your computer locally.
I recommend using ubuntu (server) on your hardware, this guide will be made for that too. Although I will try my best to also provide instructions for windows.

In order to install ubuntu server you'll need to prepare an installation media, I recommend using [balena etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) to flash your ISO to that medium. The ISO itself, you can download on the official ubuntu site.

For beginners, I recommend their desktop version:
[https://ubuntu.com/desktop](https://ubuntu.com/desktop)

For advanced users I would recommend ubuntu server:
[https://ubuntu.com/server](https://ubuntu.com/server)

Once you have the ISO and balena etcher installed, flashing is very easy.
When you're done with flashing, you can proceed to installing. On the computer itself, open the BIOS, using the `DELETE` key while starting up on desktop, or `F12`, `ESC`, `F10`, `F9` or `F11` on a laptop. If you're inside of the BIOS, navigate to security and disable secure boot. Now proceed to navigate to boot and select `LEGACY` as boot mode. This will ensure the best compatibility with ubuntu, while it does probably support UEFI, it may not work properly and cause complications. Now if you have that ready
