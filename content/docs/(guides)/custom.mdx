# Choosing your network forwarding method
## How to decide:
### Port forwarding

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Benefits">
- Faster network (lower ping)
- Easier configuration for ports
- Full control
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Cons">

- Requires access to the router
- Can be impossible on certain ISPs (CGNAT)
- Can be exploited by malicious actors (see [Port forwarding](../(forwarding)/portforwarding.mdx))
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Reverse-proxy

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Benefits">
- Very safe
- No need to access router
- Works on almost all networks
- Simple
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Cons">
- Can be costly depending on the service (we recommend a free service)
- Can cause high ping to clients
- Can cause instable connections
- Can be a bit less reliable if the service goes down.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>
