Jointhis.party is a project aimed to continue a previous project but larger and with a slightly different goal. The goal of this previous project was to provide free subdomains for users that self-hosted a minecraft server with a certain reverse-proxy provider.

This project aims to provide a free subdomain for everything, and we also aim to provide guides for every skill level to learn how to self host. This is to make it useful not only for advanced self-hosters but also for beginners that don't know how to self-host anything.
